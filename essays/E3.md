SmartPhoneProducts2
This WOD, Invoice1, tasked us to create a sales receipt that contains five different products and computations. Our code could not be hard-coded and we had to use an HTML table. I had no problems with this WOD. The only thing I need to work on is how slow I was/my inefficiency with using find and replace; it would take me so long just changing the numbers for each variable (item1, item 2..). The WOD before this was SmartPhoneProducts_variables, which was very similar to this Invoice1 in defining variables and using document.write() to display them. It was a good intro into this WOD.
Everything that we did in class helped me for this WOD. Lectures, examples, readings, the labs — they were all extremely beneficial and made this go smoothly. Also, the fact that we could copy the HTML for the table from the website helped a lot. For the next WODs, I will make sure to review the most recent lab as well as the readings. I will also master find and replace, because seriously, it took so long changing every single item, quantity, and price number.
