My decision to major in MIS wasn’t one that came to me immediately. I had no idea what I wanted to do as I entered college, and I was taking a lot of different introductory courses to various majors that I thought I’d pursue. As my second year came around, I was starting to stress out because I was still clueless, so I decided to just pick something and stick with it. I chose accounting because it was the first thing listed on the college major list, but after taking ICS101, I realized that I had a lot of interests that coincided with MIS, and that’s where I am today.
